The Changes I made to the PDR: 

- Added the requested sections, change the numbering for adjusting the order of sections. 

- Changed the background color and changed the font. 

- Also added a underline element to the h1. Changed the background color for each section. 

- Added additional p element under the h2 element. 


Conclusion:
<a href=https://www.glueops.dev/>GlueOps</a> provides a full GitOps-driven workflow for deploying applications in production and nonprod environments. We are very fortunate to have <a href=https://github.com/venkatamutyala/>Venkata Mutyala</a> and <a href=https://github.com/fernandoataoldotcom>Fernando Rodriguez</a> from GlueOps help us build this project. Hopefully, this assignment is a special treat because it is based on what these experts think beginners should know.
